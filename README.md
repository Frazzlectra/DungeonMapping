# DungeonMapping
Mapping Program for D&amp;D


This was a personal project. It is a system in which it generates a 2d hexagonal grid of ocean. You can then edit it and turn it into a map. 
You can save the map. Then load old maps and continue working on them. It doesn't sound so impressive in these few sentences but I'm very 
proud of this project.
